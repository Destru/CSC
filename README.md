A left-leaning creative Discord server open to all lifeforms, especially silicon-based. Collaborative work happens, but this is a place to recreate and recharge first. It is an outlet for you to share your work, and as the collective shares ideas the sum of our output grows.

We are community. [You are welcome.](https://cyberpunksocial.club)
